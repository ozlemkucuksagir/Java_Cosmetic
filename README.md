This project aims to create the customer interface of a cosmetic website using the Java programming language.
The homepage features a diverse product catalog and special discounts, allowing users to explore various cosmetic products and add desired items to their carts.
Discounts applied to items in the cart are dynamically calculated, enhancing the meaningfulness of users' shopping experiences. 
This project leverages the robust capabilities of Java and user-friendly interface design to improve the effectiveness and enjoyment of the cosmetic shopping experience.
